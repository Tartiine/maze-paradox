# Maze Paradox

# 🎮 Platformer Game

Welcome to our game project, crafted with C++ and SFML.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### 🛠️ Building

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or higher. For compatibility with SFML 2.6.1 built with GCC 13.1.0, use the same or compatible GCC version.
- Download and install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/). Specifically, you need version 2.6.1 built for GCC 13.1.0 MinGW. This version ensures compatibility with the project setup.
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to manage the build process.

#### Building the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Open the cloned project folder in your preferred IDE.

3. **Configure and Build with CMake:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/cloned/repository
     ```
   - Create a build directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ```
   - Run CMake to configure the project:
     ```bash
     cmake ..
     ```
   - Build the project:
     ```bash
     cmake --build .
     ```

4. **Run the Game:**
   - After the build process completes, locate the game executable (usually found in the `build` directory) and run it.
